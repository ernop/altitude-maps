# Implementation Status Review

**Date**: January 2025  
**Purpose**: Review of `tech/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` vs actual code implementation

## Summary

Most items marked as "MISSING" or "⚠️" in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` have actually been implemented. The documentation is mostly accurate but **outdated**. The code has progressed further than the documentation indicates.

---

## Status of High Priority Items

### ✅ 1. Stage Numbering Inconsistency - **FIXED**

**Documentation says**: Uses "[1/4]", "[2/4]" format, needs to be 1-10 format.

**Actual status**: 
- ✅ All stage numbers now use 1-10 format
- ✅ Stage 2/10: Dataset determination (reports explicitly)
- ✅ Stage 3/10: Latitude-based selection (reports explicitly)
- ✅ Stage 4/10: Raw data acquisition
- ✅ Stage 6/10: Clip to boundary
- ✅ Stage 7/10: Reproject to metric CRS
- ✅ Stage 8/10: Downsample/process
- ✅ Stage 9/10: Export JSON + gzip (gzip now reports explicitly)
- ✅ Stage 10/10: Update manifest

**Files updated**: `ensure_region.py`, `src/pipeline.py`

---

### ✅ 2. Boundary Failure Behavior - **FIXED**

**Documentation says**: `clip_to_boundary()` doesn't know if boundary is required, should raise exception when required.

**Actual status**:
- ✅ `clip_to_boundary()` now accepts `boundary_required: bool` parameter
- ✅ Raises `PipelineError` when `boundary_required=True` and boundary missing
- ✅ Returns `False` gracefully when boundary not required but missing
- ✅ Callers in `run_pipeline()` and `process_region()` catch `PipelineError` and abort pipeline

**Implementation**:
- `src/pipeline.py` lines 127-130, 139-142: Raises `PipelineError` when required
- `ensure_region.py` lines 1196-1199, 1208-1211: Same implementation
- Both files updated to handle exceptions properly

---

### ✅ 3. Hyperflat Elevation Validation - **ALREADY IMPLEMENTED**

**Documentation says**: Need to ensure `warn_only=False` in critical paths.

**Actual status**:
- ✅ Clipping validation (line 285): Uses `warn_only=False`
- ✅ Processing validation (line 527): Uses `warn_only=False`  
- ✅ Export validation (line 679): Uses `warn_only=False`

**Note**: The documentation incorrectly states this is missing - it's already implemented in all critical paths.

---

## Status of Medium Priority Items

### ✅ 4. Stage Reporting - **MOSTLY COMPLETE**

**Documentation says**: All 10 stages should be clearly logged with "[STAGE N/10]" prefix.

**Actual status**:
- ✅ Stages 2-10 all report explicitly with "[STAGE N/10]" format
- ⚠️ Stage 1 (validate region definition) doesn't report explicitly, but validation happens
- ⚠️ Stage 5 (automatic tiling) reports internally but could use more explicit "[STAGE 5/10]" prefix in tiling messages

**Minor gap**: Some internal tiling messages could be more explicit about stage number.

---

### ✅ 5. Stage 2/3 Separation - **ALREADY IMPLEMENTED**

**Documentation says**: Need to extract dataset determination into separate functions.

**Actual status**:
- ✅ `determine_dataset_override()` function exists in `ensure_region.py` (line 941)
- ✅ Reports "[STAGE 2/10]" for US states and overrides
- ✅ Reports "[STAGE 3/10]" for latitude-based selection
- ✅ Called explicitly before download in `main()` (line 2069)
- ✅ Passes selected dataset to download function

**Note**: The documentation incorrectly states this needs to be done - it's already implemented as a separate function with explicit stage reporting.

---

## What the Documentation Gets Wrong

### 1. Stage 2/3 Separation
**Docs say**: "MISSING: This logic should be separated from download functions"  
**Reality**: Already separated into `determine_dataset_override()` function with explicit stage reporting

### 2. Hyperflat Validation
**Docs say**: "MISSING: Hyperflat validation must FAIL HARD (currently `warn_only=True` in some places)"  
**Reality**: All critical paths already use `warn_only=False`

### 3. Boundary Error Handling
**Docs say**: "MISSING: Need to pass 'required' flag to `clip_to_boundary()`"  
**Reality**: Already implemented - parameter exists and raises exceptions when required

---

## What the Documentation Gets Right (but is now outdated)

### 1. Stage Numbering
**Docs say**: Needs to be fixed  
**Reality**: ✅ Fixed in this session (was using X/11 format, now 1-10 format)

### 2. Gzip Stage Reporting
**Docs say**: "MISSING: Explicit stage reporting '[9/10]'"  
**Reality**: ✅ Fixed in this session (now reports "[STAGE 9/10] Compressing with gzip...")

---

## Actual Implementation Gaps

### Minor: Stage 5 Tiling Messages
Tiling logic reports "Downloading tile 1/4..." but could be more explicit:
- Could add "[STAGE 5/10]" prefix to tiling start message
- Minor polish issue, not critical

### Minor: Stage 1 Reporting
Region validation happens but doesn't explicitly report "[STAGE 1/10] Validate region definition..."
- Validation occurs in `main()` before pipeline starts
- Could add explicit stage report for consistency

---

## Recommendations

1. **Update IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md**:
   - Mark items as completed that are already done
   - Update "MISSING" items that have been implemented
   - Focus on remaining gaps (minor polish items)

2. **Code is mostly correct**:
   - All high-priority items are implemented
   - All critical correctness issues are fixed
   - Remaining gaps are minor UX/polish items

3. **Documentation maintenance**:
   - The plan document is a useful tracking tool but needs regular updates
   - Consider marking sections as "✅ COMPLETE" when implemented
   - Archive or consolidate once all items are done

---

## Conclusion

**The code is in better shape than the documentation indicates.** The implementation plan served its purpose during development, but many items marked as "MISSING" have since been implemented. The codebase is production-ready with proper stage reporting, error handling, and validation.

**Remaining work**: Minor polish (explicit stage 1/5 reporting) and documentation updates to reflect actual state.
