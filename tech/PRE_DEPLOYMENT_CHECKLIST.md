## Summary of Changes

This release includes major camera control enhancements:
- âœ¨ **WASD/QE keyboard movement** - Unity/Unreal-style flythrough
- ðŸ“± **Touch/trackpad gestures** - Pinch zoom, pan (mobile & laptop support)
- ðŸŽ® **Alt+Left rotate** - Maya/3ds Max style tumble
- ðŸŽ¯ **F key reframe** - Quick reset to optimal view

## Critical Fixes Before This Test

###  Fixed: Keyboard Handler Conflicts
- **Issue:** F key was handled by both viewer and camera scheme (duplicate actions)
- **Issue:** No typing detection in main viewer (hotkeys active while typing)
- **Fix:** Added typing detection to `viewer-advanced.js` onKeyDown
- **Fix:** Removed F key handler from viewer (camera scheme handles it now)
- **Status:** Fixed in this session

## Testing Sections

### 1. Mouse Controls âœ“ (Core Functionality)

**Basic Mouse Operations:**
- [ ] **Left drag** = Pan (grab and drag the map)
  - [ ] Drag up -> map moves up
  - [ ] Drag down -> map moves down
  - [ ] Drag left -> map moves left
  - [ ] Drag right -> map moves right
  - [ ] Movement is smooth and responsive

- [ ] **Shift+Left drag** = Tilt (adjust viewing angle)
  - [ ] Drag down -> tilt down (see more horizon)
  - [ ] Drag up -> tilt up (more overhead)
  - [ ] Angle limits prevent camera flip
  - [ ] Releasing Shift mid-drag cancels smoothly (no jank)

- [ ] **Alt+Left drag** = Rotate (Maya style)  NEW
  - [ ] Horizontal drag -> turn left/right
  - [ ] Vertical drag -> tilt up/down
  - [ ] Same behavior as Right drag
  - [ ] Releasing Alt mid-drag cancels smoothly

- [ ] **Right drag** = Rotate (Google Earth style)
  - [ ] Horizontal drag -> turn left/right
  - [ ] Vertical drag -> tilt up/down
  - [ ] Maintains distance from focus point
  - [ ] Smooth rotation at all angles

- [ ] **Mouse wheel** = Zoom
  - [ ] Scroll up -> zoom IN toward cursor
  - [ ] Scroll down -> zoom OUT from cursor
  - [ ] Point under cursor stays visually stable
  - [ ] Minimum distance limit prevents clipping (5 meters)
  - [ ] Focus point shifts bidirectionally (smooth zoom feel)

**Edge Cases:**
- [ ] Can combine operations (pan while keyboard moving)
- [ ] No jitter at any camera angle
- [ ] Camera doesn't flip or lose orientation
- [ ] Extreme zoom in/out works correctly

---

### 2. Keyboard Controls  (New Feature)

**WASD/QE Movement:**
- [ ] **W** = Move forward (in view direction)
- [ ] **S** = Move backward
- [ ] **A** = Strafe left
- [ ] **D** = Strafe right
- [ ] **Q** = Move down (descend)
- [ ] **E** = Move up (ascend)

**Combination Tests:**
- [ ] W+D moves diagonally forward-right
- [ ] W+E moves forward and up
- [ ] All 6 keys can be combined smoothly
- [ ] Can use mouse to look around while holding WASD

**F Key Reframe:**  NEW - CRITICAL TEST
- [ ] Press **F** -> Camera reframes to show full terrain
- [ ] View centers on terrain bounds
- [ ] Entire terrain visible with margins
- [ ] Works in bars mode
- [ ] Works in surface mode
- [ ] Works in points mode
- [ ] Works after changing bucket size
- [ ] Works after switching regions
- [ ] Console logs terrain center (debugging)

**R Key Reset:**
- [ ] Press **R** -> Camera resets to initial position
- [ ] Works as fallback if F key fails

**Space Bar:**
- [ ] Press **Space** -> Toggle auto-rotate on/off
- [ ] Auto-rotate checkbox updates
- [ ] Works correctly

**Typing Detection:**  CRITICAL - NEW FIX
- [ ] Type in region search box -> WASD/F/R keys don't affect camera
- [ ] Type in bucket size input -> Keys don't affect camera
- [ ] Type in exaggeration input -> Keys don't affect camera
- [ ] Click Select2 dropdown, search -> Keys don't affect camera
- [ ] Tab out of input -> Keys resume working
- [ ] No lag or delay in typing response

---

### 3. Touch/Trackpad Gestures  (New - Cannot fully test without device)

**Mobile Touch (Phone/Tablet):**
- [ ] Single finger drag = Pan
- [ ] Two-finger pinch = Zoom (pinch in = zoom, spread = zoom out)
- [ ] Pinch zooms toward center of fingers
- [ ] No page scrolling during gestures
- [ ] Smooth and responsive

**Laptop Trackpad:**
- [ ] Two-finger drag = Pan (Google Maps style)
- [ ] Two-finger pinch = Zoom
- [ ] Both gestures work simultaneously
- [ ] Sensitivity feels natural
- [ ] Works on MacBook trackpad
- [ ] Works on Windows precision trackpad

**Notes:**
- User reported they cannot test touch gestures (no touch device)
- Should be tested on actual mobile/tablet before production deploy
- Trackpad testing requires laptop with gesture support

---

### 4. UI and Visual Feedback
