# Region Setup Complete!

## Summary

Successfully processed and deployed Japan and Switzerland elevation data for the interactive 3D web viewer.

## What Was Done

### 1. Extracted Raster Files
- Extracted `rasters_SRTMGL1.tar.gz` (Switzerland)
- Extracted `rasters_SRTMGL1-2.tar.gz` (Japan)

### 2. Processed Elevation Data
Both regions were processed with appropriate downsampling for optimal browser performance:

**Switzerland**
- Location: Swiss Alps and surrounding terrain
- Bounds: 5.6°E to 11.1°E, 45.7°N to 47.9°N
- Elevation range: 51m to 4,797m
- File size: 4.1 MB
- Data points: 665,831

**Japan (Central Honshu)**
- Location: Central Japan including Tokyo region
- Bounds: 130.4°E to 136.5°E, 32.5°N to 36.2°N
- Elevation range: -78m to 1,949m
- File size: 3.2 MB
- Data points: 681,240

### 3. Updated Web Viewer
- Added regions to the manifest
- Files exported to `generated/regions/`
- Both regions now available in the region selector

### 4. Started Localhost Server
- Server running on http://localhost:8000
- Viewer URL: http://localhost:8000/interactive_viewer_advanced.html
- Browser should have automatically opened

## Available Regions

The viewer now includes:
1. **USA (Contiguous)** - 12 MB
2. **Switzerland** - 4.1 MB
3. **Japan (Central Honshu)** - 3.2 MB

## File Sizes

All files are appropriately sized for browser loading:
- Japan: 3.2 MB (downsampled to 811×821 pixels, max dimension 800)
- Switzerland: 4.1 MB (downsampled to 840×811 pixels, max dimension 800)
- USA: 12 MB (larger region, still reasonable)

These sizes are well within modern browser capabilities and should load quickly even on slower connections.

## How to Use

1. Open http://localhost:8000/interactive_viewer_advanced.html in your browser
2. Use the region selector in the controls panel to switch between USA, Switzerland, and Japan
3. Interact with the 3D visualization using mouse controls
4. Adjust visualization settings in the control panel

## Server Control

To stop the server:
- Press Ctrl+C in the terminal/PowerShell window running the server

To restart the server:
```powershell
python serve_viewer.py
```

## Technical Notes

- Downsampling was automatically applied based on original data size
- Japan was downsampled with a step of 24×10 pixels
- Switzerland was downsampled with a step of 27×16 pixels
- USA masking was disabled for international regions
- All emoji characters were removed to fix Windows console encoding issues

## Files Created

- `generated/regions/japan.json` - Japan elevation data
- `generated/regions/switzerland.json` - Switzerland elevation data
- `generated/regions/regions_manifest.json` - Updated region manifest
- `serve_viewer.py` - HTTP server script
- `process_new_regions.py` - Region processing script
