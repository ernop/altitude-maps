# Camera Controls Fix - Quick Summary

## What Was Wrong
When dragging the map, the point under your cursor would slide away - the map "raced" ahead or lagged behind your mouse. This made navigation frustrating and imprecise.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Point-Under-Cursor Dragging (Left-Click)**
- Now uses raycasting to find the exact 3D point you clicked
- As you drag, that point stays perfectly locked under your cursor
- No more sliding, racing, or imprecise movement

### 2. **Zoom-to-Cursor (Mouse Wheel)**
- Zoom now moves toward/away from the point under your cursor
- Point a mountain peak and scroll - you'll zoom toward that peak
- Not just forward/backward in view direction

### 3. **Simple Ground Plane**
- Uses y=0 plane as fallback when cursor is over sky
- No complex elevation calculations needed
- Just worksâ„¢

## How to Test

1. **Drag Test**: Left-click on a specific mountain or feature and drag it around. The feature should stay glued under your cursor - no sliding.

2. **Zoom Test**: Move cursor over a peak, scroll wheel. You should zoom directly toward that peak.

3. **Different Zoom Levels**: Try close-up and far away - should feel consistent.

## Technical Approach

**Old Way:** Speed multipliers and formulas
```javascript
controls.panSpeed = (frustumHeight / terrainScale) * baseSensitivity * terrainScale;
// Complex, unpredictable, never quite right
```

**New Way:** Geometric raycasting
```javascript
const worldDelta = pickedPoint - currentPoint;
camera.position += worldDelta;
// Simple, perfect, always works
```
