# Release Notes - October 28, 2025
## Camera Control Enhancements

---

## Overview

This release brings major enhancements to the interactive 3D viewer's camera controls, making it more accessible, professional, and familiar to users from various backgrounds (Google Maps, Unity, Maya, mobile apps).

**Status:** Code complete, ready for testing
**Breaking Changes:** None - all changes are additive or improvements
**Migration Required:** None

---

## New Features

### 1. WASD/QE Keyboard Flythrough ⌨

Unity/Unreal-style first-person camera movement for exploring terrain:

-**W** - Move forward (in view direction)
-**S** - Move backward
-**A** - Strafe left
-**D** - Strafe right
-**Q** - Descend (move down)
-**E** - Ascend (move up)

**Details:**
- Works simultaneously with all mouse controls
- Smooth 60fps continuous movement
- Keys can be combined (W+D = diagonal forward-right)
- Speed: 2.0 units per frame (may need tuning per terrain scale)
- Focus point moves with camera (maintains ground plane model)

**Implementation:** `js/ground-plane-camera.js` - Lines 296-322, 545-582

---

### 2. F Key Reframe

Instantly reframe camera to show entire terrain (Maya/Blender/Unity style):

- Press**F** -> Camera repositions to optimal view of full terrain
- Centers on terrain bounds with comfortable margins
- ~30deg viewing angle (overhead but not flat)
- Works in all render modes (bars, surface, points)
- Updates when switching regions or changing bucket size

**Use Cases:**
- Got lost exploring? Press F to reset
- Loaded new region? F shows you the full view
- Changed settings? F reframes appropriately

**Implementation:**
- Camera: `js/ground-plane-camera.js` - Lines 315-317, reframeView() method
- Viewer: `js/viewer-advanced.js` - Terrain bounds calculation in createTerrain()

---

### 3. Touch & Trackpad Gestures

Mobile and laptop users can now navigate naturally:

**Mobile Touch (Phones/Tablets):**
- Single finger drag -> Pan
- Two-finger pinch -> Zoom (pinch = zoom in, spread = zoom out)
- Pinch zooms toward center of fingers

**Laptop Trackpad (MacBook, Windows Precision):**
- Two-finger drag -> Pan (Google Maps style)
- Two-finger pinch -> Zoom
- Both gestures work simultaneously

**Details:**
- Prevents page scrolling during gestures
- Zoom sensitivity: 1% per pixel of pinch distance change
- Touch IDs tracked properly (handles multi-touch)
- Maintains ground plane model (focus stays at y=0)

**Implementation:** `js/ground-plane-camera.js` - Lines 327-543

**Testing Note:** User cannot test touch gestures (no touch device). Should be tested on actual mobile/tablet before production.

### 4. Alt+Left Drag Rotation

Maya/3ds Max/Cinema 4D users can now use familiar controls:

-**Alt+Left drag** -> Rotate/tumble around focus point (same as right-drag)
- Horizontal drag = turn left/right
- Vertical drag = tilt up/down
- Graceful cancellation if Alt released mid-drag

**Compatibility:**
- Matches Maya's tumble behavior
- Matches 3ds Max's orbit behavior
- Matches Cinema 4D's rotate behavior
- Professional 3D tool users have familiar muscle memory

**Implementation:** `js/ground-plane-camera.js` - Alt+Left handling in onMouseDown/onMouseMove

---

### 5. Smart Typing Detection

Keyboard shortcuts now disable automatically when typing:

- Type in region search -> WASD/F/R keys don't affect camera
- Type in bucket size input -> Keys don't move camera
- Type in Select2 dropdown search -> No conflicts
- Click outside input -> Keys resume working immediately

**Detects:**
- INPUT tags
- TEXTAREA tags
- SELECT tags
- contentEditable elements
- Select2 search fields

**Implementation:**
- Camera: `js/ground-plane-camera.js` - Lines 298-310
- Viewer: `js/viewer-advanced.js` - Lines 1948-1960

---

## Fixes

### Critical: Keyboard Handler Conflicts

**Issue:**
- F key was handled by both viewer-advanced.js (resetCamera) and ground-plane-camera.js (reframeView)
- Both handlers would fire simultaneously, causing unpredictable behavior
- No typing detection in viewer's onKeyDown, so hotkeys active while typing

**Fix:**
- Added typing detection to viewer-advanced.js onKeyDown
- Removed F key handler from viewer (camera scheme now handles it exclusively)
- Added comments clarifying which handler manages which keys
- R key kept as fallback in viewer

**Files Modified:**
- `js/viewer-advanced.js` - Lines 1947-1990

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Touch Gestures Untested
- User has no touch device to test on
- Should be verified on actual mobile/tablet before production
- Implementation follows standard patterns (should work)
- Trackpad testing also limited

### F Key Terrain Bounds
- Implementation assumes terrain bounds are set correctly
- Edge case: Bounds might be incorrect in some render modes
- Monitor for issues after deployment

### No Visual Mode Indicators
- No cursor changes or overlays showing current mode
- Professional tools often show "Pan" / "Rotate" / "Zoom" indicators
- Future enhancement consideration

### Three-Finger Gestures Not Supported
- Only two-finger gestures implemented
- Some users might expect three-finger for rotation
- Future enhancement consideration

## User Benefits

### For General Users
-**Intuitive:** Google Maps-style controls on trackpad
-**Mobile-friendly:** Native touch gestures
-**Keyboard support:** WASD for quick exploration
-**Quick reset:** F key instantly reframes

### For Professional 3D Tool Users
-**Maya/3ds Max:** Alt+Left works like you expect
-**Unity/Unreal:** WASD flythrough familiar
-**Blender:** F key to frame works the same

### For Researchers/Educators
-**Presentation mode:** F key for consistent framing
-**Accessibility:** Multiple input methods (mouse, keyboard, touch)
-**No conflicts:** Type freely without camera jumping

## Support & Rollback

### If Issues Found
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Test in different browser (Chrome vs Firefox)
3. Verify region data loaded correctly
4. Check F key actually calls reframeView (not resetCamera)

### Rollback Plan
All changes are in JavaScript - can quickly revert:
```powershell
git checkout HEAD~1 js/ground-plane-camera.js js/viewer-advanced.js
.\deploy.ps1 -RemoteHost ...# Redeploy old version
```

### Getting Help
- Check `PRE_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` for detailed testing
- Review `learnings/SESSION_20251028_*.md` for implementation details
- Check `.cursorrules` for camera control architecture
