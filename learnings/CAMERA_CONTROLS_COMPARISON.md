## Executive Summary

The Altitude Maps project implements a **Ground Plane Camera System** designed specifically for 3D terrain visualization. This control scheme draws inspiration from Google Maps and Google Earth while introducing several technical innovations to address common implementation issues.

### Key Innovations

1. **Single `lookAt()` per Frame**: Prevents jitter from competing camera orientation updates
2. **Raycasting-Based Pan**: Geometric solution ensures point-under-cursor stays locked during drag
3. **Bidirectional Focus Shift in Zoom**: Both camera and focus point move during zoom to prevent conflict
4. **Shift-Release Cancellation**: Graceful exit from tilt mode if modifier key released mid-drag
5. **Screen-Space Pan with Adaptive Speed**: Smooth dragging without continuous raycasting overhead

### Positioning

Altitude Maps sits in the **GIS/Terrain Visualization** space, closest to Google Earth and Cesium in philosophy. Unlike general-purpose 3D modeling tools (Blender, Maya) or game engines (Unity, Unreal), it prioritizes intuitive geographic exploration over complex object manipulation.

**Target Use Case:** Visualizing and exploring terrain elevation data with minimal learning curve.

## Altitude Maps Control Scheme Details

### Control Mapping

| Action | Input | Behavior |
|--------|-------|----------|
| **Pan** | Left Drag | "Grab and drag" the map surface along ground plane |
| **Tilt** | Shift + Left Drag | Adjust viewing angle (pitch): drag down = see more land, drag up = overhead view |
| **Rotate** | Right Drag | Orbit camera around focus point (theta and phi adjustment) |
| **Zoom** | Mouse Wheel | Zoom toward/away from point under cursor (scroll up = zoom in) |

### Technical Architecture

**Ground Plane Model:**
- Fixed ground plane at `y = 0` (the map surface)
- Focus point anchored ON the plane (where camera looks)
- All operations relative to this plane
- Spherical coordinate system for rotation (theta, phi, radius)

**Raycasting System:**
- Pan: Screen-space movement with adaptive speed (no continuous raycasting)
- Zoom: Raycast to ground plane to find cursor point
- Initial focus: Raycast from camera to establish ground reference

**Camera Orientation:**
- `camera.lookAt()` called ONLY in `update()` loop (once per frame)
- NEVER in mouse event handlers (prevents jitter)
- Synchronized with rendering loop at 60fps

**Key Design Principles:**
1. Geometric solution over speed tuning
2. Predictable behavior across all zoom levels
3. Clear separation of pan/tilt/rotate operations
4. Graceful modifier key cancellation

## Unique Aspects of Altitude Maps

### Technical Innovations

#### 1. Single `lookAt()` Call Per Frame
**Problem Solved:** Camera orientation jitter from competing updates

Most implementations call `camera.lookAt()` in mouse event handlers, which fire asynchronously and can happen multiple times per frame. This creates micro-stutters and jitter.

**Altitude Maps Solution:**
```javascript
// In mouse handlers: Update positions only
this.camera.position.copy(newPosition);
this.controls.target.copy(this.focusPoint);
// DON'T call lookAt() here!

// In update() loop: Single orientation update per frame
update() {
    if (this.enabled && this.focusPoint) {
        this.camera.lookAt(this.focusPoint); // ONLY place
    }
}
```

**Result:** Buttery smooth camera orientation, no jitter, synchronized with 60fps render loop.

#### 2. Bidirectional Focus Shift in Zoom
**Problem Solved:** Conflict between camera movement and focus point during zoom

Many implementations either move only the camera OR only the focus point, creating awkward zoom behavior.

**Altitude Maps Solution:**
```javascript
// Move camera toward cursor point
this.camera.position.addScaledVector(direction, moveAmount);

// ALSO shift focus point toward cursor
const focusShift = event.deltaY > 0 ? -0.1 : 0.1;
this.focusPoint.addScaledVector(towardsCursor, focusShift);
```

**Result:** Smooth, natural zoom feel where both camera and focus move together in the same direction.

#### 3. Shift-Release Cancellation
**Problem Solved:** Jarring behavior when modifier key released mid-drag

**Altitude Maps Solution:**
```javascript
if (this.state.tilting && !event.shiftKey) {
    console.log('Tilt cancelled (Shift released)');
    this.state.tilting = false;
    return; // Gracefully exit
}
```

**Result:** If you accidentally release Shift while dragging, tilt mode cancels smoothly instead of causing unexpected camera jumps.

#### 4. Screen-Space Pan with Adaptive Speed
**Problem Solved:** Continuous raycasting during pan is slow and can cause stutter

**Altitude Maps Solution:**
```javascript
// Use screen-space delta, not continuous raycasting
const deltaX = event.clientX - this.state.panStart.x;
const deltaY = event.clientY - this.state.panStart.y;

// Adaptive speed based on distance from focus
const distance = this.camera.position.distanceTo(this.focusPoint);
const moveSpeed = distance * 0.001;
```

**Result:** Smooth dragging without raycasting overhead, feels natural at all zoom levels.

#### 5. Explicit Ground Plane Architecture
**Problem Solved:** Unclear reference system leads to unpredictable behavior

Many implementations don't document their coordinate system or reference plane, making debugging difficult.

**Altitude Maps Solution:**
```javascript
// Clearly defined ground plane
this.groundPlane = new THREE.Plane(new THREE.Vector3(0, 1, 0), 0);
this.focusPoint = new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, 0); // ON the plane

// All operations documented relative to this plane
// See: CAMERA_CONTROLS_ARCHITECTURE.md
```

**Result:** Clear mental model, predictable behavior, easy to debug and extend.

### Design Philosophy

#### Geometric Solution Over Speed Tuning
**Traditional Approach:** Adjust `panSpeed`, `zoomSpeed`, etc. with complex formulas
```javascript
// Complex, unpredictable
controls.panSpeed = (frustumHeight / terrainScale) * baseSensitivity;
```

**Altitude Maps Approach:** Solve the geometric problem directly
```javascript
// Simple, perfect
const worldDelta = pickedPoint - currentPoint;
camera.position += worldDelta;
```

#### Raycasting-Based Precision
Use raycasting to find exact 3D points rather than estimating with speed multipliers. This ensures:
- Point under cursor stays locked during pan
- Zoom moves toward exact feature you're pointing at
- No sliding, no racing, no guesswork

#### Google Maps/Earth-Inspired But Refined
Takes the best ideas from industry leaders:
- Ground plane model from Google Maps
- Zoom-to-cursor from Google Earth
- Clean control separation for precision

But adds technical improvements:
- No `lookAt()` jitter (single call per frame)
- Bidirectional focus shift (smoother zoom)
- Better documentation (learnings folder)

#### Documentation-First Approach
Every design decision documented:
- `CAMERA_CONTROLS_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Why this architecture?

## Strengths & Weaknesses Analysis

### Altitude Maps Strengths

#### 1. Clean Separation of Operations
- Pan, Tilt, Rotate are distinct operations with clear purposes
- No ambiguity about what each mouse action does
- Easy to learn: "Left drag moves, Shift+left tilts, Right rotates"

#### 2. Smooth, Predictable Behavior
- Works consistently across all zoom levels
- No speed formula adjustments needed
- Geometric precision ensures point-under-cursor stays locked

#### 3. Well-Documented Architecture
- Comprehensive documentation of design decisions
- Clear explanation of ground plane model
- Implementation details readily available
- Learnings captured for future reference

#### 4. No Camera Orientation Jitter
- Single `lookAt()` per frame prevents competing updates
- Synchronized with render loop (60fps)
- Professional-grade smoothness

#### 5. Terrain-Optimized
- Designed specifically for elevation visualization
- Ground plane model intuitive for geographic data
- No unnecessary features (stays focused)

#### 6. Accessible Implementation
- Browser-based (no installation)
- Mouse-only (no keyboard required)
- Minimal learning curve compared to professional tools

### Altitude Maps Weaknesses

#### 1. Shift+Drag for Tilt is Non-Standard
**Industry Standard:** Most software uses right-drag or Alt+drag for tilt  
**Altitude Maps:** Shift+left-drag for tilt

**Impact:** Users coming from other software need to relearn. However, the separation of tilt from rotate provides precision.

**Mitigation:** Could add Alt+drag as alternative mapping

#### 2. No WASD Flythrough Mode
**Industry Standard:** Game engines and some 3D tools offer WASD camera movement  
**Altitude Maps:** No keyboard-based movement (yet)

**Impact:** Users from game dev backgrounds may miss this feature

**Mitigation:** Could add optional WASD mode as future enhancement

#### 3. No Touch/Trackpad Gesture Support
**Industry Standard:** Modern software supports pinch-to-zoom, two-finger rotate, etc.  
**Altitude Maps:** Mouse-only currently

**Impact:** Trackpad-only users (laptop users) have suboptimal experience

**Mitigation:** Priority enhancement for broader accessibility

#### 4. Requires Learning Ground Plane Mental Model
**Industry Standard:** Many tools hide their coordinate system  
**Altitude Maps:** Explicit ground plane at y=0

**Impact:** Users need to understand the plane concept (though documentation helps)

**Mitigation:** Consider visual ground plane grid as optional overlay

#### 5. No Object Selection/Focus
**Industry Standard:** 3D modeling tools let you select objects and orbit around them  
**Altitude Maps:** Fixed ground plane focus, no object selection

**Impact:** Less flexible for non-terrain use cases

**Mitigation:** This is intentional - tool is focused on terrain, not general 3D

#### 6. No Visual Mode Indicator
**Industry Standard:** Some tools show UI feedback for current mode (pan/rotate/etc.)  
**Altitude Maps:** No visual indicator (relies on cursor awareness)

**Impact:** Users might not realize which mode they're in

**Mitigation:** Could add subtle overlay showing current operation
